# Insurance-cost-predictions-
"This project aims to predict insurance costs based on individual attributes using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can estimate insurance premiums by analyzing features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, number of dependents, and region of residence. The process involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying machine learning algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, or random forest to train the model. The analysis seeks to provide accurate cost predictions, helping insurance companies to assess risk and set premium amounts efficiently."

ðŸ“Œ Objective:
Predict insurance costs using machine learning based on factors like age, BMI, smoker status, number of children, and region.

Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Smokers have higher insurance costs.
BMI has a direct impact on insurance charges.
Machine Learning Models Used:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor (Best Performing Model)
Evaluation Metrics:
MAE: 4250.06
MSE: 37,743,576
RMSE: 6,143.58
ðŸ”¹ Outcome: Gradient Boosting Regressor provided the most accurate predictions. Future improvements include hyperparameter tuning and feature expansion.
